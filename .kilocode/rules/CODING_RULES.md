# General Coding Rules for Readable Code (Medium Skill Level)

## 1. Code Structure
- Use clear and consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces).
- Group related code into functions or modules.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.

## 2. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `getUserName`).
- Use PascalCase for classes and constructors (e.g., `UserProfile`).

## 3. Comments & Documentation
- Write comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- Use JSDoc or similar for documenting functions and parameters.
- Avoid obvious comments (e.g., `// increment i` for `i++`).

## 4. Code Quality
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants instead.
- Do not repeat code (DRY principle).
- Handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages.

## 5. Readability
- Limit line length to 80-120 characters.
- Add blank lines between logical code blocks.
- Use whitespace to improve clarity.

## 6. Best Practices
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).
- Avoid deeply nested code; refactor if needed.

## 7. Version Control
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Commit related changes together.

Following these rules will help ensure your code is readable, maintainable, and easy for other medium-skill developers to understand and work with.
